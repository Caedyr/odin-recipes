# odin-recipes
A silly little website for practice, outlined by the Odin Project.

This is one of the earliest Odin Project lessons, and involves designing a simple HTML based recipe website to start. It should involve the standard practices of an index page, organized files, and adherence to proper HTML code and commits.

As described by the project itself, the simplicity will leave it looking brutal. And seeing as I am committed to all of this day-in, day-out, hours and hours of software dev study I've been doing, clearly I have a fondness for things being brutal.
