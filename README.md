# odin-recipes
A practice website, outlined by the Odin Project.

This is one of the earliest Odin Project lessons, and involves independently designing a simple HTML based recipe website. It should involve the standard practices of an index page, organized files, and adherence to proper HTML code and commits.

As described by the project itself, the simplicity will leave it looking brutal. As I am committed to all of this day-in, day-out, hours and hours of studying software dev however, clearly I have a fondness for things being brutal.
