        <h2>A canned delight!</h2>
        <p>Yes, really. I mean that. To those who haven't tried it before, spam is hardly an appealing prospect; Its canned meat, looks pale, and has a name commonly associated with unwanted messages nowadays. But hear me out:</p>
        <p>Just try it.</p>
        <p>I promise you, its pretty good.</p>
        <h2>Ingredient List</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>One can of spam musubi</li>
                <li>Six cups of cooked sushi rice</li>
                <li>1/4 cup soy sauce</li>
                <li>1/4 cup mirin</li>
                <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
                <li>Nori roasted seaweed, cut into thirds</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Recipe Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut the spam into four to eight even slices lengthwise, depending on how thick you want it to be.</li>
                <li>Set a medium sized, non stick pan to medium heat. Add 1 tsp of olive oil.</li>
                <li>Add the spam to the pan for about three minutes, flipping until both sides are slightly golden.</li>
                <li>Remove the spam from the pan, placing on paper towers to drain the oil. Clean the pan.</li>
                <li>Set the pan on high heat. Add the soy sauce, mirin, and sugar to the pan, and once its all mixed through and begins to simmer, turn the heat low.</li>
                <li>Re-add the spam. Turn to coat, and once coated, remove from the heat.</li>
                <li>Using either the spam can, or a musubi mold, fill the mold with about an inch of rice on a strip of nori. Remember to keep the mold wet with water to prevent sticking!</li>
                <li>Remove the mold, set a slice of spam on top, and wrap the nori around. The nori can be sealed with a droplet of water if needed.</li>
            </ol>
